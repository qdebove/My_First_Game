# My First Game

## Introduction

My first game, created without any refactoring. Using jQuery and old JS without good graphics !

## Biography

I think I should introduced myself :

My name is Quentin DEBOVE, a French guy who started coding on June 2016.

My previous job was optometrist, but due to some personals problems I choose to be reoriented in programming.

I started learning HTML 5, CSS 3, jQuery. After some weeks, I learn NodeJS (with express framework).

Since October, I study in the CEFIM of Tours (a town in France) and learn more on SQL, PHP and Java.

This first game, without any title (because it don't deserved at) was started around mid-July and after a small month, was terminated. After, I started an API on NodeJS.

So finally, this is my first "official" version, you'll have access to the API and can play multiple game at the same time. Enjoy it !

## Rules

The most difficult point for me because they are only temporary.

The game is a simple battle card game with a small medieval environment.

### Affinity

You have 3 types of card : Shield, Axe and Bow.

So if your are familiar with Strategic Games like Age of Empire, you know that :

* Shield beat Bow and loose over Axe.
* Bow beat Axe and loose over Shield.
* Axe beat Shield and loose over Bow.
